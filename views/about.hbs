      <p>Although experimental submarines had been built before, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and they were adopted by several navies. Submarines were first widely used during World War I (1914–1918), and now figure in many large navies. Military usage includes attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military), submarines, aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example using a cruise missile), and covert insertion of special forces. Civilian uses for submarines include marine science, salvage, exploration and facility inspection/maintenance. Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair. Submarines are also used in tourism, and for undersea archaeology.</p>

      <h1>Programme Team</h1>
      <p>As this is a large and complex programme involving seven Trusts it is essential that the workstreams share their conclusions. To ensure this happens a small Programme Office has been formed. They will support the Workstream Managers and their Chief Executive Sponsors and ensure that the integrity of the Programme is maintained. Several appointments have been made so far and these are:</p>

      <p><strong>Programme Director</strong> - Chris Linacre (part-time)<br>
         <strong>Programme Manager</strong> - Janette Watkins (as well as initial Workstream Manager for Sharing and Adopting Good Practice)<br>
         <strong>Programme Medical Director</strong> - Dr Des Breen (part-time)<br>
         <strong>Programme Finance Manager</strong> - Wayne Lugton (part-time)<br>
         <strong>HR Manager</strong> - Heidi King (as well as Workstream Manager for Locums)<br><br>
         A Programme Administrator will also support the team.<br>

      <p>Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (and/or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes. In modern submarines, this structure is the "sail" in American usage, and "fin" in European usage. A "conning tower" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional layout. Submarines change the amount of water and air in their ballast tanks to decrease buoyancy for submerging or increase it for surfacing.</p>
